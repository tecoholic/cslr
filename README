What the repo contains?
-----------------------
This repo contains the code that was written for the project and the 
circuit diagram of the project. It consist of two parts one is the AVR
based device part written in "c" on WinAVR and the second is the 
PC based serial communication form written in VisualBasic on Visual 
Studio 2008 obtained as a part of free distribution for student use by
Microsoft.

The "C" files themselves are commented and inline documented, while the 
VB files lack documentation but can be easily understood by anyone 
taking up VB.
