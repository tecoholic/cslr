What the repo contains?
-----------------------
This repo contains the code that was written for the project.
It consist of two parts one is the AVR based device part written in "c" 
on WinAVR and the second is the PC based serial communication form 
written in VisualBasic on Visual Studio 2008 obtained as a part of free 
distribution for student use by Microsoft.

The "C" files themselves are commented and inline documented, while the 
VB files lack documentation but can be easily understood by anyone 
taking up VB.
